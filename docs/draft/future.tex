\subsection{Power Model}
\emph{Watt's Happening} currently reports applications' use of hardware resources without linking resource usage directly to power draw.
A power model that correlates a specific resource's use to battery draw would allow battery depletion to directly link to the responsible application.
%This would enable 

\subsection{User Model}
Developing a model of usage for specific user/device pairings would allow finer-tuned use models.
A user with a strong routine of device use will currently see very conservative estimates from \emph{Watt's Happening}, especially if battery depletion is high immediately after a charge followed by a long period of relatively slow depletion. 
A well-designed user model could account for usage habits and incorporate this information into the recommendation engine.

\subsection{Recommendation Engine}
Currently, \emph{Watt's Happening} provides lists of applications weighted by specific resource consumption.
A more robust recommendation engine could provide a single list of recommended actions, incorporating the user model, the power model, and past recommendations taken.
Past recommendations accepted would indicate the user's flexibility and priorities for the device.
If the user does not want to terminate a particular program, recommending this action does not ultimately aide the user, even with a very resource and battery intensive application.
