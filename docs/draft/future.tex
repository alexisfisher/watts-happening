\subsection*{Power Model}
\emph{Watt's Happening} currently reports application's use of hardware resources without linking resource usage directly to power draw.
A power model that correlates a specific resource's use to battery draw would allow applications to be directly linked to battery depletion.
%This would enable 

\subsection*{User Model}
Developing a model of usage for specific user/device pairings would allow finer-tuned use models.
A user with a strong routine of device use, especially if battery depletion is high immediately after a charge followed by a long period of relatively slow depletion, will currently see very conservative estimates from \emph{Watt's Happening}. 
A well-designed user model could account for usage habits and incorporate this information into the recommendation engine.

\subsection*{Recommendation Engine}
Currently, \emph{Watt's Happening} provides lists of applications weighted by specific resource consumption.
A more robust recommendation engine could provide a single list of recommended actions, incorporating the user model, the power model, and past recommendations taken.
Past recommendations accepted would indicate the user's flexibility and priorities for the device.
If the user is not willing to terminate a particular program, recommending this action does not ultimately aide the user, even if the application is very resource and battery intensive.
