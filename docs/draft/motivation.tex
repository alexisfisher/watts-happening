Mobile devices, including smart phones and tablets, are nearly ubiquitous, and function as an integral part of modern life. 
These devices are capable of performing an ever-increasing array of tasks. 
Unfortunately, short battery life severely limits the full potential of mobile devices. 
As battery technology lags behind increasing demands, devices need to intelligently use power resources. 
Unfortunately, many application developers do not take into account these power limitations, or even realize the power draws of their applications on disparate devices. 
A user may experience erratic power surges based on different applications and might not know if his or her device will last until the next opportunity to recharge. 

While power analyzing applications exist, many are intended to aid application developers rather than end users \cite{Pathak:2012:ESI:2168836.2168841} \cite{energy-aware}. 
Of the power saving applications available for users, some complain of the applications being too intrusive. 
These applications disable important features of the phone without user knowledge and make practical usage of the device very difficult. 
Compounding this problem, common users remain blissfully unaware of their power use until their phone reaches a minimum battery threshold.
This need for an application to inform the user of high usage applications is what motivated the work behind \emph{Watt's Happening}.
