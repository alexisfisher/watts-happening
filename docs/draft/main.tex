\begin{abstract}
The rapid growth in mobile computing power has provided mobile devices with increased capabilities. 
Unfortunately, the widening gap between power consumption and battery technologies
results in shorter battery life, which severely limits the full potential of mobile devices.
%Widespread use of mobile devices has 
%Mobile devices are prominent, but battery technology is lagging behind.
%Batteries constrain device use more than other hardware, as power draw increases.
% design 
These issues inspired our creation of \emph{Watt's Happening}, an Android application that aids users in maximizing their device's battery life.
% evaluation results
We provide the user with a tool to prolong their device's battery life by displaying high-use applications that the user can terminate to the benefit of battery longevity.
% conducted a variety of real-world tests, and 
We conducted a variety of real-world tests, and determined the application offers appropriate recommendations.
