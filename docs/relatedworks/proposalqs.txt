1) How does this address our predictability goal?
	Specific recommendations allow the user to make the necessary tradeoff
	decisions between current functionality and future battery needs.
	
2) Do you say which app to use if there are several?
	No, we will not. This level of complexity would require monitoring exactly
	what function each app provides to the user, and maintaining a current
	list of equivalent applications.  User app selection is complex and may
	have a variety of factors that we are not aware of.

3) Can you be more specific?
	We plan to list currently running apps and the predicted change in
	achievable running time if the app is killed.

4) How does this compare to existing energy monitors?
	Existing energy monitors look at what you're doing and may provide
	guidance, but do not appear to allow the user to set a goal of
	no-charge-until time. Existing apps do not appear to model user behavior
	to automatically turn on/off radios based on previous experience.
